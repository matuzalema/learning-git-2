		<p>Easy come, easy go <br>
		That's just how you live, oh <br>
		Take, take, take it all <br>
		But you never give,<br>
		Should have knownbr <br>
		you was trouble from the first kiss <br>
		Had your eyes wide open, <br>
		Why were they open?</p>
		
		<p>Easy come, easy go<br>
		That's just how you live, oh<br>
		Take, take, take it all<br>
		But you never give,<br>
		Should have known<br>
		you was trouble from the first kiss<br>
		Had your eyes wide open,<br>
		Why were they open?</p>
		
		<p>Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash,<br>
		You tossed it in the trash, you did.<br>
		To give me all your love is all I've ever asked<br>
		Cause what you don't understand, is</p>

		<p>I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
		Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
		I'd jump in front of a train for ya ( yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
		You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh<br>
		I would go through all this pain,<br>
		Take a bullet straight through my brain,<br>
		Yes, I would die for ya baby,<br>
		But you won't do the same.</p>

		<p>No, no, no, no<br>
		Black, black, black and blue beat me till I'm numb<br>
		Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you from<br>
		Mad woman, bad woman<br>
		That's just what you are, yeah,<br>
		You'll smile in my face<br>
		then rip the brakes out my car.</p>
