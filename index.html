	<h1>Grenade</h1>
	<h2>Bruno Mars</h2>
	<p>Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give,
Should have known
you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?</p>
	<p>Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash,<br>
	You tossed it in the trash, you did.<br>
	To give me all your love is all I've ever asked<br>
	Cause what you don't understand, is</p><br>

	<p>I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
	Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
	I'd jump in front of a train for ya ( yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
	You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh<br>
	I would go through all this pain,<br>
	Take a bullet straight through my brain,<br>
	Yes, I would die for ya baby,<br>
	But you won't do the same.</p>
